## Abstract
One of the biggest fears of buying clothes online is the lack of trying them before the purchase. This project aims to help customers to perform a virtual try on before the purchase and help stylists to create and try new clothes on virtual models starting with a simple silhouette. <br />

We created a linear pipeline, all the steps aim to keep code the simplest possible, trying to generalize and increase the situation in which the system can perform, especially from the customer point of view.<br />
We want to provide good results even without powerful cameras and with photos taken from amatour.<br />

We used a first version of the Unimore dataset [Dress Code: High-Resolution Multi-Category Virtual Try-On](https://aimagelab.ing.unimore.it/imagelab/page.asp?IdPage=47), in fact the dataset version provided to us does not have all the feature of the original one but we take the challenge to create a good system with limited resources.<br />
